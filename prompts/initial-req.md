I would like to design a website/app for a physiotherapy center which has both public and private view as a website and a management site. On the public front it should provide a typical Home, Services, Blogs, Contact like menus. It should be a customizable site so that we can configure any other clinic for the same. It should be a mordern looking website and a responsive design for mobile, tab and computers.
We need to implement this as a SEO friendy and one should be able to easily configure SEO keyowrks for a better SEO ranking.
We need to use modern dark theme with orange and levender color as this is part of our logo. An inspiration can be found at

For now our focus is only on the website(public facing).
